Specifications for the CLI Assessment
Specs:

 Have a CLI for interfacing with the application - run .bin/menu_count to initialize and call a new instance of the MenuCount::CLI class
 Pull data from an external source - MenuCount::Scraper method .scrape_items pulls data from the McDonald's menu at https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/full-menu.html.
 Implement both list and detail views - interact with the CLI and first receive a list of menu categories. Then, select a category to see its menu items ranked by calorie count.
